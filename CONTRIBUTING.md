<h1>Contributing to Sensor Fusion and Autonomous Racing Cars</h1>

<p>I greatly appreciate your interest and contributions! I aim to make participating in this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reporting a bug</li>
  <li>Discussing the current state of the code</li>
  <li>Submitting a fix</li>
  <li>Proposing new features</li>
  <li>Becoming a maintainer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development Practices</h2>
<p>I use GitHub to host code, track issues, feature requests, and accept pull requests.</p>

<h2>GitHub Flow</h2>
<p>All code changes happen through pull requests. I use <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html">GitHub Flow</a>, so all changes should be proposed via pull requests!:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fork the repo and create your branch from <code>ARC-1.0</code>.</li>
  <li>If you add code, please add tests!!</li>
  <li>If you change APIs, update the documentation accordingly.</li>
  <li>Ensure your code adheres to the code style guidelines.</li>
  <li>Issue the pull request!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Contributions and Licensing</h2>
<p>Any contributions you make will be licensed under the MIT Software License. By contributing, you agree that your submissions will be under the same <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT License</a> that covers the project.</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>
<p>Bugs are tracked using GitHub's issues. If you find a bug, please report it by <a href="https://github.com/AdamSadek/Sensor-Fusion-And-Autonomous-Racing-Cars/issues/new">opening a new issue</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A good bug report typically includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A brief summary and/or background</li>
  <li>Steps to reproduce</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Be specific!!!</li>
